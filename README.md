# Wanikani-Anki-Vocab-Mining Firefox extension

I don't know what I am doing

Can create Kaishi 1.5k style anki cards from wanikani vocab context sentences with [Userscript] Media Context Sentences


Anki connect needs to look like this or something
{
    "apiKey": null,
    "apiLogPath": null,
    "hook": false,
    "ignoreOriginList": [],
    "webBindAddress": "127.0.0.1",
    "webBindPort": 8765,
    "webCorsOriginList": [
        "*"
    ]
}
